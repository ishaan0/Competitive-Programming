We can use moduler arithmatic in + , - , * .
but in case of division it occurs error .

we need to get moduler inverse for that . means
instead of (x / y) % mod we need to get ( x * y^-1 ) % mod

There are several way to get moduler inverse . but 
to find a^-1 % mod , here a and mod must be co prime to each other .

linear method : 
				ax = 1 (% mod) ------------ (i)
				x  = a^-1 (% mod)

				So we need to find x for equation i to get result

Fermat's little theorem : a ^ (mod - 1) = 1 ( % mod )
						  a ^ (mod - 2) = a^-1 ( % mod )

						  So to find a^-1 we need a^(mod - 2) , where
						  mod is a prime . so it will only work when 
						  mod value is prime .

Euler's theorem : 	a ^ phi(mod) = 1 ( % mod )
					a ^ phi(mod-1) = a^-1 ( % mod )

					Here we need to calculate phi to get result .
					It will only work when a and mod are co prime

Egcd method 	: 	a ^ -1 % mod = ?
					then we need to check a and mod are co prime
					or not by using egcd , if they are co prime
					then egcd(a, mod) = a * x + mod * y = gcd(a,mod)
					here x is the inverse of a . we need to handle
					x is negetive or not also .
